    <b>Air pollution costs lives</b>
    <br><br>
    <p>
      Given current air pollution levels worldwide, <b>human lives are shorter due to premature death from air pollution-related illnesses</b>.
      Studies show that the impact of air pollution is <b>higher</b> than the impact of any other cause of death, including communicable diseases like tuberculosis
      and HIV/AIDS, illnesses caused by smoking and poor water sanitation, and death from conflicts and war.
