<b>Air pollution costs lives</b>
<br><br>
<p>
  Given current air pollution levels worldwide, <b>human lives are shorter due to premature dealth from air pollution-related illnesses</b>.
  Studies show that the impact of air pollution is <b>higher</b> than the impact of any other cause of death, including communicable diseases like tuberculosis
  and HIV/AIDS, illnesses caused by smoking and poor water sanitation, and death from conflicts and war.
</p>
<br><br><br>
