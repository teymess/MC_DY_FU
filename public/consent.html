    <p>
        We would like to invite you to participate in a
        short online survey.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>You must be at least 18 years old to participate
            in this study.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>It is your choice whether to participate or not.
            </strong> Note that all questions are mandatory.
                However, you can stop at any time by closing your browser.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>We expect minimal risks for participants taking part in this study, such as
                  possible anxiety or discomfort regarding the topic of the research project.</strong> We anticipate that
                    it will take about
                    <em>3-5 minutes</em> to complete this
                    task. However, you will only be rewarded for completing
                    the task, not for the length of time you participate.
                </p>

                <p>
                      Beyond any applicable base reward, you can earn an additional reward (bonus) depending on decisions you take during the survey.<br>
                      <br>
                      <b>All payments will be translated into panel points.</b> <br><br>

                      <b>Please note that it could take up to 4-6 weeks for the additional rewards to be granted.
                        Your additional reward will be rounded up to the next highest 10 INR value.
                        Note also that it is up to the researcherâ€™s discretion to assess whether your responses are rushed,
                        inattentive, or otherwise negligent which will result in the additional incentives being revoked without
                        the possibility of dispute.</b>

                      <strong>Your part in this survey is anonymized to the
                          researchers.</strong> The researchers involved
                          may have access to anonymized experimental research
                          records. However, because of the nature of electronic
                          systems, it is possible that respondents could be
                          identified by some electronic record associated with the
                          response. Neither the researchers, nor anyone involved with
                          this study will be capturing those data. Any reports or
                          publications based on this research will use only group
                          data and will not identify you or any individual as being
                          affiliated with this project. Your
                          data may also be stored on Dynata's servers, and the
                          data there are subject to the Dynata
                          Privacy Notice and Participation Agreement.
                          Upon publication in academic journals, the anonymized data might be
                          stored in a publicly accessible data repository.

                      If you have any question or concern about the survey or want
                       to access, rectify, or erase your data under the GDPR regulations,
